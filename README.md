# NLP_Project_Sentiment_analysis
First, make sure you have NLTK installed. If you don't have it installed, you can do so using pip:
This program uses VADER to analyze the sentiment of the input text and assigns a sentiment label (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) based on the compound score. The compound score takes into account the positive, negative, and neutral sentiment scores.

You can replace the text variable with your own text for analysis. This is a basic example, and you can extend it to read text from files, analyze larger datasets, or integrate it into more complex NLP pipelines as needed.
